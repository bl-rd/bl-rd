## S'up

This is where I detail what currently has my attention. Look at [my about page](/about) for more general background info.

## Stuff I'm doing

### Learning Japanese

- Just reached level 28 of [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/)
- Working my way through [20 Short Stories for Japanese Beginners](https://www.lingomastery.com/japanese-short-stories-for-beginners/).

### This website

- Working on this site. Trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/) and I'm quite enjoying it ðŸ™‚ I had grand plans of building my own static site generator but life.
- It's being "built in the open" (not that I imagine many people will look at it) and I have all sorts of ideas about how it will eventually look

### Stuff

- ðŸ“– Reading A Clash of Kings
- ðŸŽ® Playing OlliOlli World on Switch
- ðŸŽ¨ Learning how to draw with pen and ink
- Generally going with the flow
