## How do?

My name is Bill and I'm a web developer based in sunny Cumbria, UK. This is my personal website because all self-respecting web devlopers need one! ðŸ˜…

Currently I work for Lancaster University, maintaining and developing sites like the Student Portal.

Outside of work I like climbing, skateboarding, music and books. I occassionally kid myself that I can still do parkour (it's a _mindset_!), but alas, it's getting less frequent...

## What about **right now**?

OK sure. Check out my [now page](/now).
